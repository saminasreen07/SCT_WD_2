This is my 2nd task as a web dev intern at skillcraft tech!

This task focuses on building a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It performs basic arithmetic operations and handles user input through button clicks and keyboard events. 
The project emphasizes DOM manipulation, input parsing, event listeners, and error handling to ensure accurate calculations and smooth user experience.
